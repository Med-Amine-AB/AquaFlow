                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, designed specifically to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And if you run a modified program on a server and let other users interact with it, you must also provide them access to the source code of your modified version so they can also benefit from it.

Developers that use the GNU AGPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License, giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
